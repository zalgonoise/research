# research

*A general repository for research topics and deep-dives into topics without an actual end-purpose*

___________

## Overview

This repository contains research topics that I explore through time, which have no actual attachment to a project or an application. The topics and examples in this repository will surely be present and / or exposed in other repositories or projects of mine (at least in [`zalgonoise/x`](https://github.com/zalgonoise/x)), however this repository will contain the steps, process and documentation over a specific algorithm, pattern, routine, etc.
