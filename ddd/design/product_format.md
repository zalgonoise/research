### Product Format

The final application will be initially distributed as a web application, as a HTTP API. It could potentially have a CLI client that communicates with a configured secrets store server via HTTP (performing the same HTTP calls, but from a CLI app).

While there are no plans for an actual frontend with a UI, the simplest approach to doing so would be with a Flutter / Dart project which is simple and distributable on a number of platforms.
