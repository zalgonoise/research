### Database design

Storing this data could be easily done in a simple manner, in a relational database. This database would contain at least 3 tables, for users, secrets and shared_secrets. However, this specific implementation will use two types of databases:

1. A **SQLite database** to serve as a relational database for the users and secrets / shares metadata.
2. A **Bolt database** to serve as a key-value store, holding the sensitive information for the user's secrets, the user's private encryption key and any other type of sensitive information.

Please note below how do the entities and model above translate to an RDB table structure, for this project:

#### `users` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`username` | VARCHAR(50) | |
`name` | TEXT | |
`hash` | TEXT | |
`salt` | TEXT | |
`created_at` | TIMESTAMP | |
`updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Users data will consist on the basic information they will supply when creating a user account (initially username, password and a name); however the database will not store the password -- but a salt generated when the account was created and the hash of the password with the salt appended to it*

#### `secrets` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`user_id` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`name` | VARCHAR(250) | |
`created_at` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Secrets data will consist exclusively in secret metadata and its key (as "name"); the actual secret's value is stored in Bolt, encrypted with a key that is exclusive to the user (generated by the service when the user is created)*

#### `shared_secrets` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`owner_id` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`secret_id` | INTEGER | | `secrets (id)`
`shared_with` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`until` | TIMESTAMP | |
`created_at` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Shared secrets table will hold the metadata about the share; such as from-to user IDs, the secret's ID and a time limit if set. If the secret is shared with multiple users, there will be multiple entries simliar to each other, with different `shared_with` values*
