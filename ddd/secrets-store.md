## Concept

This document will cover the process of building a secrets / password store web application, in Go. The main goals and features of the app are the following:

- exposing a key-value store for secrets (confidential data), where the keys are of type `string` and the values are of type `[]byte` (slice of bytes / byte array).
- basic IAM support, with multiple users being able to use the service independently and privately. Users login with a username+password combination
- ability to share secrets among users, optionally scoped for a certain period of time.

This document will cover the entire process of designing, building and deploying the Go backend for this app. This document was written with Go currently on version 1.19, on January 2023.

## Design 

This will be a monolith code-base with a touch of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, to allow a readable structure and isolated responsibilities among the different packages. As a whole, the project's organization will focus on:

1. Separating transport, service and repositories. Each layer will have their own set of responsibilities.
2. Decoupling the implementations, so that they can be easily refactored and / or re-implemented with a different solution / technology stack.
3. Joining the different modules is deferred to the factory package. This allows a bigger focus on the package that we're working on focusing on inputs and returns.
4. No `pkg`, nor `util`, nor `helpers`, nor `models`; at least for the app's logic. This is done on the corresponding module.

### App structure

The entities in this model are simple, there are users who create secrets, and these secrets can be accessed by either the owner or other users if the secret is shared. The diagram below showcases this model:

![Diagram](./media/Secr_Diagram.jpg)

Of course, the app will have a few other services to support authentication, authorization and encryption, for example. But these services are not the core-purpose of the app.

### Entities

Like the diagram above implies, at least two entities are necessary: User and Secret.

#### User

```go
package user

// User is a person (or entity) that uses the application to store
// secrets. They will have a unique username.
type User struct {
	ID        uint64
	Username  string
	Name      string
	Hash      string
	Salt      string
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UpdatedAt time.Time
}
```

> A user object will store the user's ID and basic information, a hash of their (salted) password and the salt; as well as created / updated timestamps

#### Secret

```go
package secret

// Secret is a key-value pair where they Key is string type and Value
// is a slice of bytes. Secrets are encrypted then stored with a user-scoped
// private key
type Secret struct {
	Key       string
	Value     []byte
	CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

> A secret object will hold its key-value data, as well as a timestamp value for when it was created


```go
package secret

// Shared is a type of secret that a user (the owner) shares with a set of users
// optionally within a limited period of time
type Shared struct {
	Secret
	Owner  user.User
	Shares []user.User
	Until  time.Time
}
```

> Shared secrets will be objects wrapping a Secret, that also have an owner (User), and shares (slice of User). Optionally, a shared secret can be scoped for a period of time


### Database design

Storing this data could be easily done in a simple manner, in a relational database. This database would contain at least 3 tables, for users, secrets and shared_secrets. However, this specific implementation will use two types of databases:

1. A **SQLite database** to serve as a relational database for the users and secrets / shares metadata.
2. A **Bolt database** to serve as a key-value store, holding the sensitive information for the user's secrets, the user's private encryption key and any other type of sensitive information.

Please note below the SQLite tables structure for this project:

#### `users` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`username` | VARCHAR(50) | |
`name` | TEXT | |
`hash` | TEXT | |
`salt` | TEXT | |
`created_at` | TIMESTAMP | |
`updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Users data will consist on the basic information they will supply when creating a user account (initially username, password and a name); however the database will not store the password -- but a salt generated when the account was created and the hash of the password with the salt appended to it*

#### `secrets` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`user_id` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`name` | VARCHAR(250) | |
`created_at` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Secrets data will consist exclusively in secret metadata and its key (as "name"); the actual secret's value is stored in Bolt, encrypted with a key that is exclusive to the user (generated by the service when the user is created)*

#### `shared_secrets` table

col. name | type | PK | FK
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
`id` | INTEGER | Yes |
`owner_id` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`secret_id` | INTEGER | | `secrets (id)`
`shared_with` | INTEGER | | `users (id)`
`until` | TIMESTAMP | |

> *Shared secrets table will hold the metadata about the share; such as from-to user IDs, the secret's ID and a time limit if set. If the secret is shared with multiple users, there will be multiple entries simliar to each other, with different `shared_with` values*
